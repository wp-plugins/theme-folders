A plugin to sort themes. For an easy overview about your favorite Themes.

== Description ==

Did you ever struggle with to many themes in your WordPress installation?  I had enough of the messy theme page on WordPress Backend. As developer I need sometimes a ranking for themes. So I decided,  there have to be a way to label themes or assign a category in this case a folder to them. 

That is why I was writing a code to folder WordPress themes. 
Load different groups of themes into the wp-content. Go to the Admin Page under Appearance -> Theme Folders and give the names of the different folders. Now you have folder view of different theme groups.

Then you can preview themes from certain categories or delete them.



== Installation ==

1. Upload 'theme-folders' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'plugins' menu in WordPress.
